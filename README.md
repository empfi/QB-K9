🚨 **QB-Core Police K9 Script** 🐶  

💾 All interactions with Players or the Dog are made with QB-Target!
Unleash the ultimate K9 experience for your FiveM server! This QB-Core based script brings a fully interactive police dog system to your roleplay. Officers with the right job and rank (configurable, e.g., `3+`) can collect a loyal K9 from a designated station 📍 and command it with ease.  

**Features**:  
- 🐕 Spawn a customizable K9 (e.g., Husky) that follows, barks, and attacks on command.  
- 🚶‍♂️ Smart follow mechanics with teleportation if the dog gets stuck or too far.  
- ⚔️ Attack queue system: Order your K9 to engage targets, with automatic handling of dead or distant enemies.  
- 🛑 Toggle wait mode (sitting with godmode) or recall your K9 with a keybind (`O` by default).  
- 🏥 Auto health regeneration for the dog when not in combat.  
- 🏠 Optional shelter system: Dogs walk to/from a shelter for immersive spawning/despawning.  
- 🎯 QB-Target integration for seamless interactions (bark, attack, wait).  
- 💀 Death detection ensures the K9 is removed if critically injured, with a notification to grab a new one.  
- 🚘 Driving Buddy: The Dog gets in your car!

Perfect for police RP servers looking to add a dynamic and immersive K9 unit! Fully configurable via `config.lua` to match your server’s needs. Try it now and let your officers patrol with their four-legged partner! 🐾
